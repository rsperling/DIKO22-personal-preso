**Built a reliable and productive service delivery team**

_"It's not about the wins or losses; the purpose is to help your players be the best versions of themselves on and off the field. Leadership is about the long-game, not the short-term wins. Invest in unlocking the potential of people, and the results will follow."_ 
-- Ted Lasso
